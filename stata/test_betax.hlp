{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:test_betax} can be used to perform hypothesis tests on the causal effect (betax) parameter in Krauth (2015).  
The specific testing method used here is to "invert" the Imbens-Manski confidence interval.  That is we reject the null that betax equals 
some number at 5% significance if and only if that number is not in the Imbens-Manski 95% confidence interval.  This test inherits
the desirable properties of the Imbens-Manski confidence interval, but is unusual in that it does not generate a test statistic.

{phang}
{cmd: test_betax} is a postestimation command for {cmd: rcr}. {p_end}
{phang}
{cmd:. rcr y z x1 x2 x3 x4 x5}{p_end}
{phang}
If {cmd: test_betax} is executed without arguments, the test will be of betax = 0. {p_end}
{phang}
{cmd:. test_betax}{p_end}
{phang}
Other null hypotheses can be specified explicitly.{p_end}
{phang}
{cmd:. test_betax  = 1}{p_end}
