Description: This package estimates bounds on a linear causal effect under
    a user-specified interval restriction on the (unknown)` correlation
    between the variable of interest and unobservables relative to the
    (known) correlation between the variable of interest and observables.
    The details of the estimation method are described in my paper
    "Bounding a linear causal effect using relative correlation
    restrictions" (Journal of Econometric Methods 2016).
