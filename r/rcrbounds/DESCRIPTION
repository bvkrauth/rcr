Description: Estimates bounds on a linear causal effect under
    a user-specified interval restriction on the (unknown)` correlation
    between the variable of interest and missing/unobserved variables relative
	to the (known) correlation between the variable of interest and observable
	variables. The details of the estimation method are described in my paper
    "Bounding a linear causal effect using relative correlation
    restrictions" (Journal of Econometric Methods 2016).
